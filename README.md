What is it?
===========

`process-explorer-web` is a nodejs application to manage processes on a linux
system. It is also possible to run it on Android using the
[process-explorer-app](http://github.com/opersys/process-explorer-app) Android
project.

Installation
============

Required node packages
----------------------

You'll need grunt-cli:

    npm install --global grunt-cli

Then in order to `grunt pack`, you will need to install the dependencies
locally:

    npm install

Binary files
------------

### ARM architecture

We have already built them for you, but in case you want to reproduce the
binaries, check the `bin/arm/README.md` for more information.

### ia32 / amd64 architecture

In the root directory, run the following to install required makefiles:

    npm-gyp configure

Then, build the application:

    npm-gyp build

Resulting binary will be installed in `build/Release/pswalk.node`.

Move the binary into its place, so that it will be packaged:

    mv build/Release/pswalk.node bin/ia32 # (or x64)

Packaging with grunt
--------------------

Given a working node and Grunt install, simply run:

    grunt pack

The package will be installed in the `dist` directory.

Using process-explorer-web
--------------------------

After you've packaged the nodejs app, simply run the following:

    node dist/app.js

And browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) !

process-explorer-app assets
---------------------------

The `process-explorer-app` project requires `process-explorer-web` to run
correctly on Android. Thoses assets are generated by the `grunt pack` command
so you simply have to copy the resulting files to your `process-explorer-app`
work tree.

The assets will be output in the "out" and can be copied directly into the
"assets" directory of the `process-explorer-app` project.

    cp out/process-explorer.zip out/process-explorer.zip.md5sum \
        .../process-explorer-app/assets
